# Butterfly puzzle

A puzzle is said to be _cubelike_ if its basic moves correspond to
elements of the symmetric group such that each move is a product of
_k_ disjoint _m_-cycles and therefore the states of the puzzle
correspond precisely to the elements of the group generated by these
moves. Rubik's cube is one example of a cubelike puzzle (where each move is a product of 5 disjoint 4-cycles).

This is another cubelike puzzle. In particular it is one of a family
of cubelike puzzles made by placing two or more equal circles on the
plane, each pair being either separate or being a fixed distance
appart. This particular instance has two circles with their centres a
distance 1 apart and their radii being between $\sqrt 5 \over 2$ and $
5 \sqrt 2 \over 6$.

# Usage

Open up `main.html` in a web browser. The four buttons correspond to
each of the moves forwards or backwards. You can save your current
combination of moves into another 'move' (i.e. a group element) and
then do it in forwards or reverse. Hover over the button for a new
move to see a representation of it in disjoint cycle notation
(although the correspondence between the numbers in the permutation
and the tiles in the puzzle is not specified). One good first step is
trying to come up with combinations of moves which produce single
cycles. Try commutators (i.e. do one thing, then something else, then
the first thing in reverse). For example $[g_1,g_2]^{12}$ is a single
5-cycle.
